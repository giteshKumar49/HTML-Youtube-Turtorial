NOTE:  whenever you are studying this refer the documentation and see for the
       atttributes used with the tag....

1. Shortcuts : * Alt + Shift + DownKey ---> Duplicates the line
   * Alt + Click on place wou want to edit, creates multiple
   cursors to edit the text.
   (USEFUL to edit the ending and opening of the tags)

2. h6 is the most less used heading as if your page needs h6 then you might
   need a new page altogether.

3. Title attribute can be used with any tag.
4. As we will learn react the instead of writing <br> for line break, use
   <br />. 
5. As HTML don't know about the linespaces so there is one classic problem with HTML,
   which is CLASSIC POEM PROBLEM inside a paragraph (<p></p>).
   * to tackle the abopve problem we can use linebreaks <br> but this is not a
     good way to do this. Insted of this use <pre></pre> tag, it will preserve
     the formatting of the text inside it.
   * pre tag, inside it we will be writing codes in tit as it will not do 
     auto formating and we can manipulate it by using CSS or JS.
